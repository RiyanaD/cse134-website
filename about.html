    <p>
      I am a student at UC San Diego pursuing a B.S. in Computer Science, Class of 2026.
      I have been studying computer science since high school and am
      comfortable coding in C, C++, Java, Python, HTML, CSS, Javascript, React,
      and more. I have experience in both Software Engineering and AI/ML development. I am highly interested in gaining industry experience in Full-Stack Software Engineering, Generative AI, Cloud Computing, and DevOps!

      I also enjoy
      contributing to open-source projects and exploring new technologies! In my free time,
      I love to dance, read, attend yoga classes and try different foods!
